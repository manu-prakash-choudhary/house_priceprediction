# house_priceprediction
This is a ML model made upon Linear Regression to predict the possible value of house buying in banglore providing its region, area, and number of bedrooms. It is really fun projectðŸ’™, I gained lots of knowledge while going over this.  However this project is done with the help of youtube channel.
I have created a simple webpage on which you just have to give some basic info about property such as BHK, by that only you can calculate the price you gonna be cost for that house.
